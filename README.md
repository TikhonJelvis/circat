**Circat** is a package for expressing computations in terms of `Category` and friends and then extracting circuits.
To visualize circuits, you'll need [Graphviz](http://graphviz.org) (or at least `dot`).

See the `Circat.Examples` module for examples.
For instance, run `outSimples` to construct some simple circuits, render them to PDF (easy to change), and display the results.

Dependencies:

*   [Anshul Malvi's branch](https://github.com/anshulmalvi/netlist) of the KU netlist packages
